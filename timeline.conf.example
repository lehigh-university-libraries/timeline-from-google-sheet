# timeline.conf.example
# Timeline-from-Google-Sheets (timeline.html) loads data from a Google Sheet and renders a web timeline.
# The sample Sheet has two tabs: Source and Export.
# An Apps Script mirrors edits from Source → Export and converts rich text to HTML
# (bold, italics, links, and blockquotes using lines that start with '>').
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Do NOT commit your private timeline.conf (it's ignored by .gitignore).
# - Each tab has its own numeric gid (gid=<number>). It varies per sheet.

# VIEW_URL
# - Paste the URL of the Export tab here (ends with edit?gid=<number>).
# - Share the sheet so “Anyone with the link” can “View”.
# - The web page fetches CSV from this tab.
VIEW_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/.../edit?gid=<export-gid>

# EDITOR_URL
# - Paste the URL of the Source tab here (ends with edit?gid=<number>).
# - Usually restricted to trusted collaborators with edit access.
# - Shown in the site footer as “Editor Login”.
EDITOR_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/.../edit?gid=<source-gid>
